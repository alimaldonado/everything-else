# Front End Developer Test
Basic login form made with Twig templates.
The application consists of two php files: index, where the site logic can be found and user where we can find the user object and the avaibable users array.

## Installation
After cloning repository, run `composer install` to install the twig dependency
then, you can run `php -S localhost:8000` (or use prefered port) to serve the application

## Available users
The application has two users, the "admin" user and the "john_doe" user, both with password "secure".

When the $isAdminLogin variable is set to true at index.php, only the admin user can submit a valid login and viceversa: john_doe can only login if $isAdminLogin is set to false.

If any user logs in successfully, the $totalSiteLogins variable will increment. The sites login will be set to "0.00" untill the first sucessful login is made, and after that, the variable will be set from $_SESSION["totalSiteLogins"], so the count can be saved between requests.

The submit button is rendered from it's variable at index.php

The twig template will warn when you're on admin login or on user login
